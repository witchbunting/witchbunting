### 女鹀 (Witch Bunting)

##### ABOUT ME

* A bunting who lives in a world where he is undetected occasionally emerges to catch bugs.

* A witch who is continuously exploring the actual world, studies theoretical physics in a faraway university, and investigates nonlinear dynamic systems and chaos theory.

* A new programmer with the lowest efficiency for creating a problem-solving solution.

* Python is the most commonly used programming language, but C and MATLAB will also be used. The programming language MATLAB is primarily used for scientific calculations and simulations. Of course, python is frequently used for scientific calculations, but it is less efficient than MATLAB.
